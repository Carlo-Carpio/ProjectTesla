 ## **Fiat Lux**

 Now is time to apply the concepts in the real life: let's build a [Torch](glossary://Torch).
 
 ## How to build
 
 To build the torch you need to drag the electric components from the header of the scene and drop them in the right position.
 
 **Challenge**: Let's make light.
 
 For best experience, play the game in a fullscreen `liveView`.
 
 Tap `Run My Code` to start play.
